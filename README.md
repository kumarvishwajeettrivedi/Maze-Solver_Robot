# Maze-Solver_Robot

Welcome to the Maze Solver Robot project! This project involves building a robot capable of solving mazes autonomously by following lines using Arduino and motor drivers.

Features:

Autonomous maze-solving capability.
Line following using sensors.
Customizable maze-solving algorithms.
Easy to assemble and modify.
Components:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
Motor driver module.
DC motors and wheels.
Line following sensors.
Chassis for the robot.
Power source (e.g., batteries).
Setup Instructions:

Connect the motors to the motor driver module.
Connect the line following sensors to the Arduino.
Mount the Arduino and motor driver on the robot chassis.
Upload the maze-solving algorithm code to the Arduino board.
Ensure the power source is connected and the connections are secure.
Usage:

Place the robot at the starting point of the maze.
Power on the robot.
The robot will autonomously navigate through the maze by following the lines.
Once the maze is solved, the robot will stop at the end point.
Customization:

Adjust the maze-solving algorithm in the Arduino code to suit different maze configurations.
Modify the sensor positions or add additional sensors for improved line detection.
