# Maze Solver Robot

Welcome to the Maze Solver Robot project! This project involves building a robot capable of solving mazes autonomously by following lines using Arduino and motor drivers.

## Features

**- Autonomous maze-solving capability.**  
**- Line following using sensors.**  
**- Customizable maze-solving algorithms.**  
**- Easy to assemble and modify.**  

## Components

**- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).**  
**- Motor driver module.**  
**- DC motors and wheels.**  
**- Line following sensors.**  
**- Chassis for the robot.**  
**- Power source (e.g., batteries).**  

## Setup Instructions

1. **Connect the motors to the motor driver module.**  
2. **Connect the line following sensors to the Arduino.**  
3. **Mount the Arduino and motor driver on the robot chassis.**  
4. **Upload the maze-solving algorithm code to the Arduino board.**  
5. **Ensure the power source is connected and the connections are secure.**  

## Usage

1. **Place the robot at the starting point of the maze.**  
2. **Power on the robot.**  
3. **The robot will autonomously navigate through the maze by following the lines.**  
4. **Once the maze is solved, the robot will stop at the end point.**  

## Customization

**- Adjust the maze-solving algorithm in the Arduino code to suit different maze configurations.**  
**- Modify the sensor positions or add additional sensors for improved line detection.**
