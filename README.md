# Maze Solver Robot

Welcome to the Maze Solver Robot project! This endeavor involves designing a robot capable of autonomously solving mazes by leveraging line-following technology. Built using Arduino and motor drivers, this project showcases innovative robotics and autonomous navigation techniques.

## Inspiration

The Maze Solver Robot was inspired by the classic problem of a rat navigating a maze. Our goal was to develop a solution that could emulate this behavior and tackle the challenge of autonomous maze-solving. The project not only addresses the technical problem of maze navigation but also explores the practical application of robotics in problem-solving.

## Features

**- Autonomous maze-solving capability.**  
**- Efficient line-following using analog IR sensors.**  
**- Advanced maze-solving algorithms.**  
**- Modular design for easy assembly and modification.**  

## Components

**- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).**  
**- Motor driver module.**  
**- DC motors and wheels.**  
**- Analog IR line-following sensors.**  
**- Distance sensor for enhanced navigation.**  
**- Chassis for the robot.**  
**- Power source (e.g., batteries).**  

## Setup Instructions

1. **Connect the DC motors to the motor driver module.**  
2. **Attach the analog IR line-following sensors to the Arduino board.**  
3. **Integrate the distance sensor with the Arduino for improved navigation.**  
4. **Mount the Arduino and motor driver onto the robot chassis.**  
5. **Upload the maze-solving algorithm code to the Arduino board.**  
6. **Connect and secure the power source.**  

## Usage

1. **Place the robot at the starting point of the maze.**  
2. **Power on the robot.**  
3. **Observe the robot as it autonomously navigates through the maze by following the lines.**  
4. **The robot will stop at the end point upon successfully solving the maze.**  

## Customization

**- Tailor the maze-solving algorithm in the Arduino code to accommodate different maze designs.**  
**- Adjust sensor positions or add extra sensors to enhance line detection accuracy.**  

## Presentation

Our team of three presented this project at the TechFest of IIT BHU, TechNex. The presentation highlighted the robot‚Äôs capabilities, design principles, and the innovative approach to solving the maze problem. We demonstrated how the robot efficiently navigates through various maze configurations using our custom-built algorithms and sensors.
